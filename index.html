I am a PhD student at Northeastern University primarily studying labor history and the history of migration. My interests also include
gender, occupational health and urban history. I recieved my BA (International) in Single Honours History from University College Dublin
in 2015, spending the 2013/14 year studying at Boston College. In 2015 I was awarded a Wellcome Trust Humanities Studentship for the 
Social and Cultural History of Medicine Masters program, also at UCD. My MA thesis explored occupational health and gender, looking 
specifically at the men and women working in Belfast's major industries during the period 1870-1914. My work at the doctoral level hopes 
to focus on Irish-American migration and work, with particular emphasis on gender, class and nationality as determining factors in the 
migrant expereince.
